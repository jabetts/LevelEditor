	TODO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file lists items to complete, and ideas for further ideas that need to
be fleshed out. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Menu system
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Create a menu system for the level editor, that could be imported into another
  project, sort of like an API. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Font system
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- I want the font system to be similar to old school DOS games where each letter
  was a bitmap, I want that old school look. With resolution scaling of the game
  the bitmap can be enlarged, so I want it to be able to be aligned so integer
  scaling makes it still look sharp. I will need to research this but the system
  could be plugged into other game projects I create

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Resources
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- We alreay have a good asset loader and entity manager, however I want the asset
  loader to be able to load from a large file similar to a WAD file. Where all our
  assets are stored in one large file (probably compressed) and the asset loader
  simply loads the WAD and code can pull the required asset from the loaded WAD
  file. Since memory is not n issue for the types of games, all assets will be in
  memory.
